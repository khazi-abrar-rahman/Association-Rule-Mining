# Association-Rule-Mining
This project demonstrates Association Rule Mining using the Apriori algorithm to uncover meaningful relationships between products in transactional data. The analysis is performed on the Online Retail dataset and focuses on identifying frequently purchased itemsets and generating strong association rules based on support, confidence, and lift metrics.

# Project Overview
1.Loads and preprocesses retail transaction data from an Excel file
2.Converts transaction quantities into a binary (0/1) basket format
3.Applies the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent itemsets
4.Generates association rules using lift as the primary evaluation metric
5.Filters strong rules with high confidence and lift values

# Technologies Used
Python, Pandas & NumPy, mlxtend.frequent_patterns (Apriori & Association Rules)

# Key Features
1.Efficient market basket analysis
2.Custom encoding of transactional data
3.Identification of high-value product associations
4.Rule filtering for actionable insights
